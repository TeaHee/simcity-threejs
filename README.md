# CitySim.js

## What is this?

This is an ongoing project where I attempt to create a clone of SimCity using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## How do I run this locally?

You will first need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

After that, clone this repository, navigate to the root directory and run the following command

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
